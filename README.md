Rotary is a project that I started a few month ago, my goal being to think multiplayer, the starting idea is based on what we can see on mods minecraft technic, magic, so wanting to make it a full game with its ecosystem, the game has a discord on which every bug/ suggestions and discussions around the project is made. It is currently in a very early stage of development and that is why I decide to publish something to reach all those who would like a game in the same spirit and who could bring their help/ ideas.
